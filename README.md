Miui Porting tool for curtana

Requires python and brotli, and 12GB of space minimum.

Place you Miui Rom Zip in root of the tool, with other files like port.sh then enter:

```
sudo ./port.sh romname

```

romname will be the Mod ROM's name, e.g. Xiaomi.eu, Masik, etc.

Go grab a cup of coffee, and you'll get you ported rom in 'out' dir after a while.

Enjoy.
